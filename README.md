# My New Friend
*This is the first time that I try to use #Rust for embedded development, which is a very pleasant for me to take that delayed step..*

Regardless the name of the repo (which indicates a great willing.. shhh ;)\) the code here targets the #Xtensa archeticture of #ESP32 devkit. This arch. requires some official configurations to run smoothly as other arch. like #RiscV or #ARM

I wanna thank me.. hah nah, I am blessed to Allah <3
